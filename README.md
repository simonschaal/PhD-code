# PhD-code
contains useful pieces of code related to nano-electronic measurements

## Resonant circuit simulations
`RFCircuit` is a class that facilitates analytical and numerical analysis of resonant circuits using `lcapy`, `sympy` and `numpy` packages.

## Fitting
`fit-helpers` is a collection of convenience functions for data modelling using the `lmfit` package.

## Readout fidelity
`fidelity-helpers` is a collection of functions for calculating the singlet-triplet readout fidelity based on the signal and noise obtained in an experiment. 

## Measurement code snippets
A collection of useful code snippets for measurements within the `QCoDeS` and `QDev-wrappers` environment (see forks).
